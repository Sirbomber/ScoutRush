# ScoutRush
 Just a silly little multiplayer scenario.  Two teams yearn to destroy each other... using only self-destructing scouts.  Guard Posts are available for defense.
 
 Special rules:
  - Population management is disabled for this mission.
  - Spawn points are not randomized and teams are forced.  Odd-numbered players spawn on the west side of the map.  Even-numbered players spawn on the east.
  - Structure Factories, Vehicle Factories, and Trade Centers cannot be destroyed or disabled.
  - Only ConVecs, Earthworkers, Scouts, Guard Posts, and (optionally) Lynxes are available.  All production is free and near-instantaneous.
  - Self-destruct damage has been upgraded to kill any unit in one hit.
  - Turning on Morale Steady will allow all players to build Lynxes.  Note that due to a bug, in the version that comes with OPU patch 1.4.1, Lynxes are enabled if morale steady is OFF and disabled if it is on.
  - Player resource settings controls what weapons they're allowed to build.  On Low resources, only Lasers/Microwaves and Starflares are available.  Medium resources adds Rail Gun/RPG, and High resources adds Thor's Hammer/Stickyfoam and Supernova (for Plymouth only).  EMP, Acid Cloud, and ESG are unavailable.
  - If enabled, disasters will only spawn in the middle of the map and include quakes, vortexes, and EMP Missile strikes.
